## Grover's Algorithm
Grover's Algorithm is another algorithm, similar to Shor's algorithm, that can break encryption. While Shor's algorithm mainly impacts asymmetric key cryptography (generally public-key) Grover's algorithm impacts symmetric key.
This is easily fixed by just increasing the bit size of the symmetric encryption algorithms though.
